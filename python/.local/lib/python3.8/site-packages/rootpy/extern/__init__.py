"""
This packages contains copies of python packages that are bundled
with rootpy but are external to rootpy, and hence are developed
in a separate source tree.

The reason to include these packages in rootpy is to have fewer
dependencies, i.e. fewer things to install for the end user.
And sometimes there are bugs that only surface with certain
combinations of packages, having everyone use the same version
of the external packages reduces this problem.
