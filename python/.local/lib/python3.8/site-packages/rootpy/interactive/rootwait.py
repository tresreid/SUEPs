"""
The functions in this module provide a way of pausing code execution until
canvases are closed. This can be useful when testing code and you don't want to
keep the objects alive outside of your function.

The wait function can be called repeatedly to pause multiple times.

wait_for_zero_canvases()
    Keeps root alive until CTRL-c is pressed or all canvases are closed

wait_for_zero_canvases(middle_mouse_close=True)
    allows canvases to be closed with the middle mouse button (see below)

wait is shorthand for wait_for_zero_canvases

Examples
--------

    from rootpy.plotting import Canvas
    from rootpy.interactive import wait

    c = Canvas()
    c.Update()
    wait()

    c2 = Canvas()
    c2.Update()
    wait(True)
    # This canvas can be killed by middle clicking on it or hitting
    # escape whilst it has focus
